This example introduces a smörgåsbord of various Utils class implementations in the Spring ecosystem. It looks at

BeanUtils - useful functions for dealing with JavaBeans
ClassUtils - useful functions for asking questions reflectively about types
SystemPropertyUtils - useful functions for dealing with System properties
FileCopyUtils - useful functions for copying InputStream and OutputStream implementations
AopUtils - useful functions for dealing with Spring’s AOP proxies
ReflectionUtils - useful functions for dealing with reflection, broadly
Assert - useful functions to help with design-by-contract-style assertions
CollectionUtils - useful functions for working various Java java.util.Collection types
SerializeUtils - useful functions for working with Java serialization
There’s a ton of exciting stuff, and this dense example doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface!
